p. You can see how I lived before I met you. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Why did you bring us here? Ask her how her day was. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

p. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Throw her in the brig. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.
